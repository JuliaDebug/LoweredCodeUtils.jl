module LoweredCodeUtils

# We use a code structure where all `using` and `import`
# statements in the package that load anything other than
# a Julia base or stdlib package are located in this file here.
# Nothing else should appear in this file here, apart from
# the `include("packagedef.jl")` statement, which loads what
# we would normally consider the bulk of the package code.
# This somewhat unusual structure is in place to support
# the VS Code extension integration.
